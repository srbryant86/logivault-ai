# ü§ñ LogiVault AI Autonomous Self-Healer

A zero-intervention system that automatically detects, diagnoses, and fixes any deployment or development issues with your LogiVault AI application.

## üéØ What It Does

**Completely Autonomous Operation:**
- ‚úÖ **Monitors services 24/7** - Checks your Vercel frontend and Render backend continuously
- ‚úÖ **Auto-fixes deployment issues** - Resolves Python dependencies, CORS, Git problems automatically  
- ‚úÖ **Self-heals without intervention** - No manual input required, ever
- ‚úÖ **Installs missing tools** - Automatically installs Git, Python, Node.js, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Maintains configurations** - Keeps Render, Vercel, Docker configs optimized
- ‚úÖ **Handles Git operations** - Auto-commits, pushes, resolves conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Logs everything** - Comprehensive logging of all actions taken

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: One-Time Fix (Immediate)
```bash
cd logivault-ai
python3 auto-resolver/autonomous_self_healer.py
```

### Option 2: Autonomous Mode (Continuous)
```bash
cd logivault-ai
python3 auto-resolver/autonomous_self_healer.py --autonomous
```

### Option 3: Install as System Service (Recommended)
```bash
cd logivault-ai
python3 auto-resolver/install_self_healer.py
sudo systemctl start logivault-healer
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Copy the auto-resolver folder to your project:**
   ```bash
   # The folder is already in your logivault-ai directory
   cd logivault-ai/auto-resolver
   ```

2. **Run the installer:**
   ```bash
   python3 install_self_healer.py
   ```

3. **Start autonomous mode:**
   ```bash
   ./start_autonomous.sh
   ```

## ü§ñ Autonomous Features

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Service Health Checks**: Monitors your Vercel and Render deployments every 5 minutes
- **Automatic Healing**: If a service goes down, immediately runs full resolution process
- **Failure Recovery**: Retries failed operations with exponential backoff

### Auto-Resolution Capabilities
- **Python Environment**: Fixes dependencies, creates minimal requirements.txt
- **Git Repository**: Initializes repo, configures user, auto-commits changes
- **Deployment Configs**: Creates/updates render.yaml, vercel.json, Dockerfile
- **CORS Issues**: Automatically fixes frontend-backend communication
- **Missing Tools**: Installs Git, Python, Node.js, npm, curl, wget automatically
- **Environment Variables**: Creates .env templates with proper configuration

### Self-Healing Actions
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Automatically resolves Python package conflicts
- **Build Failures**: Tries multiple installation strategies until one works
- **Service Outages**: Redeploys configurations when services go down
- **Git Conflicts**: Automatically resolves merge conflicts
- **Missing Files**: Recreates essential configuration files

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# View live logs
tail -f self_healer.log

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status logivault-healer

# View system logs
sudo journalctl -u logivault-healer -f
```

### Health Checks
The system monitors these endpoints:
- `https://logivault-ai.vercel.app` (Frontend)
- `https://logivault-ai-backend.onrender.com/healthz` (Backend)

### Automatic Actions Log
All actions are logged with timestamps:
- Tools installed
- Fixes applied
- Services healed
- Deployments triggered

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `auto-resolver/healer_config.json` to customize:

```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "check_interval_minutes": 5,
    "services_to_monitor": [
      "https://logivault-ai.vercel.app",
      "https://logivault-ai-backend.onrender.com/healthz"
    ]
  },
  "healing": {
    "max_retries": 5,
    "retry_delay_minutes": 2,
    "auto_deploy": true
  },
  "maintenance": {
    "daily_check_time": "02:00",
    "log_rotation_size_mb": 10,
    "cleanup_old_files": true
  }
}
```

## üîß Control Commands

### Service Control (if installed as service)
```bash
sudo systemctl start logivault-healer    # Start the service
sudo systemctl stop logivault-healer     # Stop the service
sudo systemctl restart logivault-healer  # Restart the service
sudo systemctl status logivault-healer   # Check status
```

### Manual Operations
```bash
./fix_now.sh                    # Run immediate one-time fix
./start_autonomous.sh           # Start autonomous mode manually
```

## üö® Emergency Recovery

If something goes wrong with the self-healer itself:

1. **Stop the service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop logivault-healer
   ```

2. **Run manual fix:**
   ```bash
   python3 auto-resolver/autonomous_self_healer.py
   ```

3. **Check logs for issues:**
   ```bash
   cat self_healer.log | tail -50
   ```

## üéØ Zero-Intervention Operation

Once installed, the system requires **absolutely no manual intervention**:

- ‚úÖ **Runs continuously in background**
- ‚úÖ **Automatically fixes any issues**
- ‚úÖ **Self-heals if it encounters problems**
- ‚úÖ **Logs all actions for transparency**
- ‚úÖ **Restarts itself if it crashes**
- ‚úÖ **Updates configurations as needed**

## üìà What Gets Fixed Automatically

### Deployment Issues
- Python dependency conflicts
- Missing system packages
- Build command failures
- Environment variable problems
- CORS configuration errors

### Development Issues  
- Git repository problems
- Missing configuration files
- Broken deployment configs
- Service connectivity issues
- File permission problems

### Infrastructure Issues
- Service outages
- Network connectivity problems
- Resource conflicts

## üîí Security & Safety

- **Read-only monitoring** of external services
- **Safe command execution** with timeouts and error handling
- **Automatic rollback** if fixes cause issues
- **Comprehensive logging** of all actions
- **No sensitive data exposure** in logs

## üìû Support

The self-healer is designed to be completely autonomous, but if you need to check what it's doing:

1. **Check the logs:** `tail -f self_healer.log`
2. **View the state:** `cat healer_state.json`
3. **See applied fixes:** Look for "fixes_applied" in the logs

## üéâ Benefits

- **Zero Downtime**: Issues are fixed before they impact users
- **No Manual Work**: Completely hands-off operation
- **Always Up-to-Date**: Keeps configurations optimized
- **Peace of Mind**: Your application is always monitored and maintained
- **Cost Effective**: No need for expensive monitoring services
